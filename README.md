# Machine-Learning-with-MATLAB
Projects developed in Matlab

######################################

The following Octave/Matlab programs have been developed from 
Coursera.org Machine Learning course offered by Professor Andrew Ng.

The topics are:
* Linear Regression with one variable
* Multivariate Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Multiclass Classification
* Neural Networks
* Bias vs. Variance
* Support Vector Machines(SVM)
* Unsupervised Learning(Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, 
   Principal Component Analysis(PCA))
* Anomaly Detection (Density Estimation, Collaborative Filtering, 
   Low Rank Matrix Factorization)
