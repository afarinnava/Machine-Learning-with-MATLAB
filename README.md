# Machine-Learning-with-Octave
Projects developed in Octave/Matlab
######################################

The following Octave/Matlab programs have been developed from 
Coursera.org Machine Learning course offered by Professor Andrew Ng.

The topics are:
1- Linear Regression with one variable
2- Multivariate Linear Regression
3- Logistic Regression
4- Multiclass Classification
5- Neural Networks
6- Bias vs. Variance
7- Support Vector Machines(SVM)
8- Unsupervised Learning(Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, 
   Principal Component Analysis(PCA))
9- Anomaly Detection (Density Estimation, Collaborative Filtering, 
   Low Rank Matrix Factorization)
